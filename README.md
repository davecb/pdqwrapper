# pdqwrapper


Prototype a path coverage test by exhaustion.  A non-prototype
version will be called pdqWrapper, and a test library will be called
pathExhaustion.

## This version
A tiny wrapper around the pdq library, for use on the command-line.
Downloads of different versions of the library from sourceforge
are here, under pdqwapper1 and pdqwrapper2.


## Current
pdqwrapper1/c contains the current c code, based on pdq5. 
go and rust contain draft translations, not linked.

## Future
pdqwrapper2 should use the newest version, https://github.com/DrQz/pdq-qnm-pkg, which see.
