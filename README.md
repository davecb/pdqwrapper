# pdqwrapper


Prototype a path coverage test by exhaustion.  A non-prototype
version will be called pdqWrapper, and the library will be called
testIterator

## This version
A tiny wrapper around the pdq library, for use on the command-line.
Downloads of different versions of the library from sourceforge
are here, under pdqwapper1 and pdqwrapper2.

## Publication version
A minimalist subset. This will become its own repo, be polished, and then the changes
backported here.

## Future
pdqwrapper2 shall use the newest version, https://github.com/DrQz/pdq-qnm-pkg, which see.
