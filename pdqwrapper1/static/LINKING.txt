Yes, you can statically link a C library to a Go program! Here are the main approaches:

Using cgo with static linking: Go provides cgo which allows calling C code directly. For static linking, you'll need to:
// #cgo LDFLAGS: -static /path/to/your/lib.a
// #include "your_header.h"
import "C"

func main() {
    C.your_c_function()
}
￼
main.go
Using pkg-config for static linking:
// #cgo pkg-config: --static your-library ### reports Package ../pdq5/lib/libpdq.a was not found in the pkg-config search path
// #include <your_library.h>
import "C"
￼
main.go
To build with static linking, use:

CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -ldflags '-extldflags "-static"'
￼
Specifying the library path directly:
// #cgo LDFLAGS: ${SRCDIR}/lib/libyour_library.a  ### reports invalid #cgo line
// #include "your_library.h"
import "C"
￼
main.go
The resulting binary will contain the C library code, making it more portable since it won't depend on external shared libraries. This is particularly useful for distribution or when deploying to systems where you can't guarantee the presence of specific libraries.

Remember to:

Have the C headers available
Properly set up CGO_ENABLED=1
Ensure your C library is compiled with -fPIC if needed
Handle any platform-specific considerations

I'll show you how to statically link a cgo program with its dependencies. Here are the key steps:

First, set CGO_ENABLED=1 to ensure cgo is active
export CGO_ENABLED=1

To statically link the C libraries, you'll need to add specific linker flags in your Go code. Here's an example:
package main

// #cgo LDFLAGS: -static -L/path/to/lib -lyourlib
import "C"

func main() {
    // Your code here
}

main.go
For the build command, use:
go build -ldflags '-extldflags "-static"'

This approach works well for most cases. Here's a complete example using SQLite as the C library:

package main

// #cgo LDFLAGS: -static -lsqlite3
// #include <sqlite3.h>
import "C"
import "fmt"

func main() {
    var version = C.sqlite3_libversion()
    fmt.Printf("SQLite version: %s\n", C.GoString(version))
}

sqlite_example.go
To verify the static linking worked, you can use the ldd command (on Linux):

ldd your_binary

If you see "not a dynamic executable" as output, the static linking was successful.

Some tips:

Make sure you have the static versions (.a files) of the libraries installed
Some libraries might require additional flags or dependencies
For complex builds, you might want to use pkg-config with appropriate flags
This should give you a fully statically linked binary that can run without external library dependencies.
